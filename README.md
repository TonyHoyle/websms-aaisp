## WebSMS-AAISP

Plugin for AAISP SMS

Does not work:

- the API apparently changed and I haven't had the ability to recompile to test 
- the websms lib isn't compatible with android studio (it contains a rogue androidmanifest.xml which breaks the build).

These are probably fixable but as the plugin had about 3 users I'll leave it to others who care enough.

# Any binaries purporting to be this plugin are probably fake - beware of malware.  This plugin has never been shipped outside the play store.
